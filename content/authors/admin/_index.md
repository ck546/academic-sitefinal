I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. I specialize in political theory and comparative development studies. Prior to joining Lingnan, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. My current research interests include the political theory of the business corporation, justice in the gig economy, data ethics, workplace justice, and comparative political theory (with a focus on Confucianism). My research has appeared in journals such as, among others, *Journal of Social Philosophy*, *Philosophy & Social Criticism*, *Review of Social Economy*, and *Information, Communication & Society*. My reserach has been awarded the Helen Potter Award by the Association for Social Economics and the Best Student Paper Award by the Association of Internet Researchers.
