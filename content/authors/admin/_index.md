Hello! My name is Chi Kwok. I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Utrecht University in The Netherlands. I am a member of the European Research Council funded project "[The Business Corporation as a Political Actor](https://businesscorporation.sites.uu.nl/)". I specialize in political theory and comparative development studies. I obtained my PhD in political theory from the Department of Political Science at the University of Toronto in November 2020. From 2015 to 2019, I served as a graduate associate at the Center for Critical Development Studies at the University of Toronto Scarborough. In 2019, I was a visiting fellow at Normative Orders at Goethe University Frankfurt in Germany.

My doctoral dissertation examines social justice and the firm, particularly in relation to injustices in the workplace, and undertakes careful consideration of alternative organizational arrangements that might constitute a more egalitarian workplace. The dissertation is entitled “Workplace Control and Workplace Injustice”. It is an interdisciplinary work that combines normative political philosophy with management studies. It analyzes three major forms of workplace control: emotion, time, and knowledge. For each form of workplace control I analyze the empirical details of how this control works in reality, and then analyze the empirical evidence concerning the positive and negative personal, social, and political impacts of such control. I then ask why some forms of workplace control should be seen as normatively problematic by engaging with the contemporary debates around distributive justice and democratic theory. In addition to the chapters investigating the normatively problematic forms of workplace control, one chapter in my dissertation asks the question of what personal and social goods might be fostered by a lower degree of workplace control and whether the democratization of the workplace can lead to a lower degree of workplace control. While substantial work concerning the normative justification of alternatives to traditional hierarchical workplaces already exist, my dissertation is unique because it integrates and synthesizes different strands of empirical and normative research to show why the issue of workplace control is a conceptually coherent and important area for research in democratic theory.

My current research in the ERC project examines the normative justification of the political power of the firm in liberal democratic contexts. The project examines how classical economic theories and legal theories conceptualize firm power and their normative implications. In addition to my research in the workplace and business corporation, I am also interested in issues data ethics and social movement. 

My research has appeared in journals such as, among others, *Philosophy & Social Criticism*, *Review of Social Economy*, *Space and Culture*, *Contemporary Political Theory*, and *China Perspectives*.
