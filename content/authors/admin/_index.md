I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. I specialize in political theory and comparative development studies. My current research interests include corporate power, the gig economy, data ethics, workplace democracy, and comparative political theory (with a focus on Confucianism). My research has appeared in journals such as, among others, *Journal of Social Philosophy*, *Philosophy & Social Criticism*, *Review of Social Economy*, and *Information, Communication & Society*.
