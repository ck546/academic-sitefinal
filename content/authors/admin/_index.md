Welcome to my homepage! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Utrecht University in The Netherlands.  I specialize in political theory and comparative development studies.

My doctoral dissertation examined social justice and the firm, particularly in relation to injustices in the workplace, and undertook careful consideration of alternative organizational arrangements that might constitute a more egalitarian workplace. It integrated and synthesized different strands of empirical and normative research to show why the issue of workplace control is a conceptually coherent and important area for research in democratic theory. My current research in the ERC project examines political theories of the corporation, with a special focus on the legitimacy and appropriate regulation of corporate power.

My research has appeared in journals such as *Philosophy & Social Criticism*, *Review of Social Economy*, *Information, Communication & Society*, among others.
