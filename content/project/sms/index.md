Identifying injustices and offering institutional alternatives are insufficient in bringing about social and political transformation. Resistance is the key to the transformation of an unjust institution to a just one, but what distinguishes a just resistance from an unjust one? This research project explores different empirical and normative dimensions of political resistance, including the mobilizational, cultural, and normative dimensions.
