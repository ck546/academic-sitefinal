abstract: Social movements are voluntary events whose participants have the
  right to leave whenever they disagree with their leaders. For this reason, the
  legitimacy of social movements is often perceived as inherent and thus of only
  secondary importance. This article aims to repudiate this view by
  demonstrating that legitimacy issues can impose constraints and have
  significant impacts on the relationships and decisions of the leaders of
  social movements. In the case of the Umbrella Movement, bottom-up legitimacy
  challenges to movement leaders’ authority not only forced the leaders to
  reform their decision-making structure and even implement direct democracy,
  but also intensified the relationships among the leaders of different
  factions, ultimately undermining the leadership’s overall effectiveness.
