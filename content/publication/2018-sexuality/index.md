abstract: This article examines the changing contours of Chinese sexuality
  studies by locating recent research in historical context. Our aim is to use
  the literature we review to construct a picture of the sexual landscape in
  China and the sociocultural and political conditions that have shaped it,
  enabling readers unfamiliar with China to understand its sexual culture and
  practices. In particular, we focus on the consequences of recent changes under
  the Xi regime for individuals’ sexual lives and for research into sexuality.
  While discussing the social and political regulation of sexuality, we also
  attend to the emergence of new forms of gendered and sexual subjectivity in
  postsocialist China. We argue throughout that sexuality in China is interwoven
  with the political system in a variety of ways, in particular through the
  tension between neoliberal and authoritarian styles of governance. We explore
  normative and dissident sexualities as well as forms of sexual conduct that
  are officially “deviant” but nonetheless tolerated or even tacitly enabled by
  the party-state. In particular, we highlight the dilemmas and contradictions
  faced by China’s citizens as they negotiate their sexual lives under
  “socialism with Chinese characteristics.”
