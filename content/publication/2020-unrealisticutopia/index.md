abstract: "The two books under review challenge two widely shared assumptions
  held by advocates of the China model: (1) that China represents a distinctive
  model of legitimation, and (2) that China is a stable authoritarian regime.
  Jiwei Ci draws our attention to the unavoidable legitimacy crisis that the
  Chinese Communist Party (CCP), as the only real party in a one-party
  authoritarian regime, will eventually need to confront. He aims to show that
  ‘grave consequences will follow if China does not democratize and do so with
  well-conceived and well-executed preparation’ (p. 16). In the same vein,
  Shih-Ding Liu shows that, despite the oppressive political structure in China,
  people exercise their agency through creative resistance that exploits the
  legal grey zones and internal contradictions of the authoritarian regime (pp.
  8–9). An oppressive political structure does not necessarily strengthen the
  stability of the regime; rather, it invites people to resist the regime
  creatively in ways that the regime cannot anticipate in advance."
