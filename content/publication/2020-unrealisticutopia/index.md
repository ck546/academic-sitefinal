  The rise of China as the second largest economy and a stable authoritarian
  regime has led political theorists to emphasize the importance of performance
  in the evaluation of regime legitimacy. Due to its ability to get things done
  efficiently and to induce rapid economic growth, China is also increasingly
  perceived as an alternative to the Western liberal democratic model of
  legitimation. The uncomfortable fact that ostensibly stable democracies are
  unable to defend themselves against right-wing populism has contributed to the
  loss of liberal democracy’s appeal. Thus, advocates of China’s model of
  legitimation such as Daniel Bell (2015, p. 3) argue that the Chinese
  authoritarian system is a political meritocracy in which political leaders
  ‘take a long-term view rather than cater to electoral cycles’ and that the
  system can ‘prevent the exercise of power by short-term-minded “populist”
  political leaders.’ In other words, advocates suggest that China represents a
  better regime in which legitimacy is gained non-democratically and thus can
  avoid the negative consequences associated with democratic election.


  The two books under review challenge two widely shared assumptions held by advocates of the China model: (1) that China represents a distinctive model of legitimation, and (2) that China is a stable authoritarian regime. Jiwei Ci draws our attention to the unavoidable legitimacy crisis that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), as the only real party in a one-party authoritarian regime, will eventually need to confront. He aims to show that ‘grave consequences will follow if China does not democratize and do so with well-conceived and well-executed preparation’ (p. 16). In the same vein, Shih-Ding Liu shows that, despite the oppressive political structure in China, people exercise their agency through creative resistance that exploits the legal grey zones and internal contradictions of the authoritarian regime (pp. 8–9). An oppressive political structure does not necessarily strengthen the stability of the regime; rather, it invites people to resist the regime creatively in ways that the regime cannot anticipate in advance.
