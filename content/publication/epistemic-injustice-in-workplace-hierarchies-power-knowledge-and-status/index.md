abstract: Contemporary workplaces are mostly hierarchical. Intrinsic and
  extrinsic bads of workplace hierarchies have been widely discussed in the
  literature on workplace democracy and workplace republicanism. However, a
  distinctively intrinsic relational bad, epistemic injustice in the workplace,
  has largely been neglected by both normative theorists of the workplace and
  theorists of epistemic injustice. This article, by bringing in the insights of
  Miranda Fricker’s influential conceptualization of epistemic injustice, argues
  that hierarchical workplaces have contributed to and reinforced both
  testimonial and hermeneutical injustices in a central activity of most
  people’s daily lives. This article argues that these injustices are moral
  wrongs and thus moral injury to the workers. The article concludes by
  demonstrating that traditional hierarchy is the most epistemically unjust form
  of hierarchy, while contestatory hierarchy, because of its emphasis on
  granting the right to the workers to be listened, is less unjust
  epistemically.
