abstract: Space plays a vital role in structuring and forming social movements
  into particular shapes—especially via its physical settings, the
  representation constructed through dominant and alternative discourses, and
  protesters’ spatial practices therein. Geographers and urban theorists have
  long argued that public space is of paramount significance to collective
  actions. Yet we know less about how a sustainable, manageable, and iconic
  public space for continuous movement mobilization is created. This article
  uses Victoria Park, an iconic public space of contention in Hong Kong, as a
  case to examine how a contentious political space is made. Through archival
  research, we demonstrate how the Defend Diaoyutai Islands Movement of the
  1970s transformed the park from an “empty” recreational space to a political
  space. People’s political actions made this transformation of the spatial
  order possible. Nonetheless, the British colonial government re-policed the
  spatial norms of the space, which in turn regulated both the government and
  protesters. The study affords significant opportunities for thinking about the
  spatial constraints of contentious politics.
