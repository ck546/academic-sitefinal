abstract: Work is an integral part of modern society. However, the question of
  the normative conditions that distinguish just from unjust work has been
  under-investigated in political theory. This article, by comparing the Lockean
  and Marxist views of just work, aims to show that a set of overlapping
  normative requirements of just work can be derived from them despite their
  polarized economic and political views. Locke has been appropriated by
  contemporary libertarians as the central figure of right-based libertarian
  market economy while Marx has been seen by the left as a central intellectual
  resource to criticize capitalismâ€™s tendency for degrading work. Given this
  usual polarization, the article can shed light on a common set of normative
  requirements concerning just work between them. This overlapping set of
  normative requirements of just work invites reflections on possible common
  grounds of just work between the contemporary right and the left who have
  appropriated the two thinkers as their foundational theoretical building
  blocks.
