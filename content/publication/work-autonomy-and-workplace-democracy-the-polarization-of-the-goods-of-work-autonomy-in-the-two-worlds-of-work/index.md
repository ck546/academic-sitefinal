abstract: Political theorists have been framing the problems of unfreedom and
  domination at work as inconsistent with the requirements of political
  democracy, undermining the democratic potential of the workplace and inducing
  psychological and status harm. Although these are important insights,
  political theorists are often unwilling to frame the hierarchical workplace as
  an issue of distributive justice. This paper, by bringing in the empirical
  literature on work autonomy, offers a framework to explicate the relationship
  between freedom at work and the distribution of essential goods at paid work.
  Through such framework, the paper argues that procedural and substantive
  freedom at work are essential to the fair distribution of the goods of work.
  By examining the empirical literature, the paper further argues that there
  exists a polarization of the goods of work between high-skilled and
  low-skilled labor, and the polarization offers a pro-tanto justification of
  workplace democracy for the least advantaged workers.
